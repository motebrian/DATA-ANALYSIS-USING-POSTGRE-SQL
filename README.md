## Project Description

This project explores a supermarket sales dataset using PostgreSQL to extract insights related to sales trends, profitability, customer behavior, and pricing. The dataset includes information about purchases, item codes, wholesale prices, item names, category codes, quantities, selling prices, sales or returns, discounts, sales revenue, and loss rates.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project includes the following columns:
- **Date:** The date of purchase
- **Item_Code:** Codes representing items sold
- **Wholesale_Price:** The wholesale price of items per kilogram
- **Item_Names:** The names of the items
- **Category_Codes:** The categories for the items
- **Quantity:** The quantity sold in kilograms
- **Selling price:** The item's selling price per kilogram
- **Sale or Return:** Indicates whether the item was sold or returned
- **Discount:** Indicates if there was a discount (Yes/No)
- **Sales:** Calculated as Quantity multiplied by Selling price
- **Loss_Rate:** The loss rate percent of each item

## Objectives

### Objective 1: Analyze Sales Performance

#### Total Sales by Category
```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(sales.itemsales), 0) AS Total_Sales, items.category_name AS Categories
FROM sales
JOIN items ON sales.item_code = items.item_code
GROUP BY Categories
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;
```

#### Best Performing Products by Sales
```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(sales.itemsales), 0) AS Total_Sales, items.item_name AS Products
FROM sales
JOIN items ON sales.item_code = items.item_code
GROUP BY Products
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Worst Performing Products by Sales
```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(sales.itemsales), 0) AS Total_Sales, items.item_name AS Products
FROM sales
JOIN items ON sales.item_code = items.item_code
GROUP BY Products
ORDER BY Total_Sales ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Top Selling Products by Quantity
```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(sales.quantity_sold_kg), 0) AS Total_Sales, items.item_name AS Products
FROM sales
JOIN items ON sales.item_code = items.item_code
GROUP BY Products
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Effect of Discount on Sales
```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(sales.itemsales), 0) AS Total_Sales, items.item_name AS Products
FROM sales
JOIN items ON sales.item_code = items.item_code
WHERE discount = 'Yes'
GROUP BY Products
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Objective 2: Investigate Profitability

#### Most Profitable Categories
```sql
SELECT 
    items.category_name AS Category,
    AVG(ROUND(sales.unit_selling_price_kg - wholesale_price.wholesale_price_kg, 0)) AS AVG_PROFIT
FROM 
    sales
JOIN 
    items ON sales.item_code = items.item_code
JOIN 
    wholesale_price ON sales.item_code = wholesale_price.item_code
GROUP BY 
    items.category_name
ORDER BY 
    AVG_PROFIT DESC;
```

#### Products with the Highest Loss Rates
```sql
SELECT items.item_name AS PRODUCTS, ROUND(SUM(loss_rate.loss_rate_percent), 2) AS PERCENT_LOSS
FROM items
JOIN loss_rate ON items.item_code = loss_rate.item_code
GROUP BY PRODUCTS
ORDER BY PERCENT_LOSS DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Objective 3: Examine Sales Trends and Customer Behavior

#### Seasonal Trends in Sales
```sql
SELECT
  date_part('year', date) AS year,
  date_part('month', date) AS month,
  date_trunc('month', date) AS month_start
FROM
  sales
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Aggregate Sales by Month
```sql
SELECT
  date_part('year', date) AS year,
  date_part('month', date) AS month,
  SUM(itemsales) AS total_sales
FROM
  sales
GROUP BY
  year, month
ORDER BY
  year, month;
```

#### Top 5 Months with the Highest Sales
```sql
SELECT
  year,
  month,
  total_sales
FROM (
  SELECT
    date_part('year', date) AS year,
    date_part('month', date) AS month,
    SUM(itemsales) AS total_sales
  FROM
    sales
  GROUP BY
    year, month
) AS monthly_sales
ORDER BY
  total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Objective 4: Understand Pricing and Margins

#### TOP 10 Most Expensive Products Based on Average Selling Price
```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(wholesale_price.wholesale_price_kg), 2) AS AVG_Wholesale_Price,
      ROUND(AVG(sales.unit_selling_price_kg), 2) AS AVG_Selling_Price,
      items.item_name AS Products
FROM 
  sales
JOIN 
  wholesale_price 
  ON sales.item_code = wholesale_price.item_code
JOIN 
  items 
  ON sales.item_code = items.item_code
GROUP BY 
  Products
ORDER BY 
  AVG_Selling_Price DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Wholesale Prices Across Categories
```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(wholesale_price.wholesale_price_kg), 2) AS AVG_Wholesale_Price,
      items.category_name AS Category
FROM 
  wholesale_price
JOIN 
  items 
  ON wholesale_price.item_code = items.item_code
GROUP BY 
  Category
ORDER BY 
  AVG_Wholesale_Price DESC;
```
